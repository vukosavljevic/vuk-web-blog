                    <h3>Why did I start this blog ? </h3>
                    <p>Actually the reason why I started this blog was because i needed some expirience and some
                        challange for my brain with new Vue.js project and I came up with the idea to make Blog because
                        that would sum up all the thing i learned in Vue.</p>

                        tried many hobbies like solving rubik's cube or doing yoyo and ofcourse sport that i like which
                        is volleyball. I would say for myself that I am really hard-working and patient person that
                        loves to do the job right and at time. Currently I am attending 3rd grade at <a

                    <p>Null Design is a 5-member team based in Croatia. That contains friends from my class. We came up
                        with an idea to do something at this young age that would benefit us later. So we made Null
                        Design which is an team that makes immaculate website like no others. Null Design exists already
                        2 years and I learned a lot about Team Leading, importance of communication and so on.</p>
